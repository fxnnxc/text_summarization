# Experiments

## üßö‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è : Train freezed BART with addtional moudule
* Goal : Get higher ROUGE score with freezed bart with addtional module. 
* Rule
  * Do not test with more than 1 day. 

### 1. Is learning rate important?

* Token : 20210129

* Setup
  1. Model : BART + BGN(Bag of words Generator Network) from the encoder
  2. Criterion : ROUGE score
  3. Data : XSum

*  Conditions
   *  learning rate(3e-5, )
   *  training  w/wo combining the linear layer of the transformer
* Result

* Conclusion


### 2. Train with addtional path from encoder and use it only for the first word. 
* Additional module helps to predict the first word which is the most important choice. 

* Setup
  1. Model : BART + BGN from the encoder but I add it only to the first part
  2. Criterion : ROUGE score
  3. Data :  XSUM

* Conditions
  * start from pretrained verision.
  * Learning rate (3e-5)
  * Warm UP  (500)
  * Epoch  (5)
