* controlling the information transmitted through the VAE channel. The trade-off between the amount of informa- tion encoded in a latent code during training, and the generative capacity of the model.
* Sender-Receiver in a communication network. ***R*** : rate which measures the compression level of z as compared to the original message x. ***D*** : overall performance of the communication in encoding a message at sender and successfully decoding it at the receiver ***I(x;z)*** : the capacity of the encoder channel (Mutual Information)
