### Text Summarization brench

one paper before transformer : 
using transformer :
 + variations  :  
--> I want Encode the global information!!!!
### Variational brench

VAE
beta-VAE : 
annealing schedules  : at least 2 
--> KL Vanishing!!!
### ELBO analysis : 
InfoVAE, ELBO surgery, Enhancing Variational Autoencoders with Mutual Information Neural Estimation for Text Generation
--> What is current?

### CVAE(two papers : Improved Variational Neural Machine Translation by Promoting Mutual Information )
Two papers without transformer 
using transformer 

--> What is good approach for the Text Summarization

### Ours~!!
