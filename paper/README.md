## Introduction brench

1. Text Summarization brench

        one paper before transformer : 
        using transformer :
        + variations  :  
        --> I want Encode the global information!!!!
        
2. Variational brench

        VAE
        beta-VAE : 
        annealing schedules  : at least 2 
        --> KL Vanishing!!!     
3. ELBO analysis 
 
        InfoVAE, ELBO surgery, Enhancing Variational Autoencoders with Mutual Information Neural Estimation for Text Generation
        --> What is current?

4. CVAE(two papers : Improved Variational Neural Machine Translation by Promoting Mutual Information )

        Two papers without transformer 
        using transformer 

        --> What is good approach for the Text Summarization

        Ours~!!
